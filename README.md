Project Overview :
Air pollution is a growing concern in urban areas, with significant health risks for residents. This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on historical data of pollutants and weather conditions in India. Using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques, this project provides insights into air quality trends and builds a foundation for accurate AQI prediction.

Dataset :
The project uses data from the Kaggle dataset: Air Quality Data in India (2015–2020). The dataset includes information on various pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, etc.), temperature, humidity, and other meteorological factors across multiple Indian cities.

Additional dataset used: Indian Cities Database (provides geospatial information) - Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/indian-cities-database

Technologies and Libraries :
Python (Core Language)
Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Static Visualization)
Plotly, Folium (Interactive Visualization)
Scikit-learn (For future predictive modeling)
Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)

Setup Instructions :
1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Required Packages - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the Dataset
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook 

Running Instructions :

1. Data Loading & Cleaning: The notebook begins by loading and preprocessing the datasets. Missing values are handled using interpolation and imputation techniques.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   * Visualize pollutant trends over time.
   * Create interactive maps showing air quality across cities using Folium.
   * Identify seasonal variations and hotspots.
3. Model Building (Future Work): Machine learning models like linear regression and random forests will be implemented to predict AQI.
4. Results Visualization: Insights are presented through static and interactive plots.
5. Export Results: Final datasets and visualizations are saved for reporting.
   
Assumptions :

* The data is assumed to be accurate and consistent across all monitoring stations.
* Seasonal variations significantly affect AQI.
* The effect of external factors like weather, crop burning, and traffic congestion is indirectly reflected in the pollutant levels.
  
Performance Considerations :

* Scalability: The solution can handle larger datasets by using efficient data structures and vectorized operations in Pandas. For even larger data, migrating to distributed systems like Dask or PySpark is recommended.
* Memory Usage: Data types are optimized to reduce memory usage. Future enhancements could include chunked data loading for memory efficiency.
* Visualization: Interactive visualizations (using Plotly and Folium) might be computationally expensive for very large datasets. Consider limiting the data shown or using server-side rendering.
  
Results :

* The project reveals key patterns in air pollution across Indian cities from 2015 to 2020.
* Seasonal and geographical factors influence AQI levels significantly.
* The future integration of machine learning models will enable accurate AQI prediction and real-time monitoring.
  
Future Work :
* Machine Learning Integration: Build models for AQI prediction using features such as pollutant levels, weather data, and time-based factors.
* Real-Time Dashboard: Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor AQI and forecast future trends.
* Incorporate External Data: Include additional features like traffic data, satellite images, and real-time weather reports for improved accuracy.
  
Data Privacy Considerations :

* The dataset used does not contain personally identifiable information (PII).
* If future iterations involve user-level data, privacy measures like anonymization and compliance with GDPR and other regulations will be implemented.
